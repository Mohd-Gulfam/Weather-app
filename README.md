☀️ React WeatherWise
📝 Overview
React WeatherWise is a modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) designed to provide users with accurate, real-time weather data and a 5-day forecast for any location worldwide.

This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in core React.js concepts, efficient API data fetching, and component-based UI design.

✨ Key Features
Real-Time Data: Fetches and displays current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

5-Day Forecast: Shows an hourly or daily breakdown of future weather.

Search Functionality: Allows users to easily search for weather by city name.

Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Unit Toggle: Simple button to switch between Celsius ( 
∘
 C) and Fahrenheit ( 
∘
 F).

Dynamic Backgrounds: Changes the background image or theme based on the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy). (Optional: Add this only if implemented)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
